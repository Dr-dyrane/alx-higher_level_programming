## Project Description

This project is a collection of SQL queries and database management tasks designed to help you practice and improve your SQL skills. Each task focuses on a specific aspect of SQL, such as user management, table creation, and data retrieval. By completing these tasks, you will gain hands-on experience in working with databases and writing efficient SQL queries.

## Tasks

The project consists of the following tasks:

1. Task 0: My privileges!
2. Task 1: Root user
3. Task 2: Read user
4. Task 3: Always a name
5. Task 4: ID can't be null
6. Task 5: Unique ID
7. Task 6: States table
8. Task 7: Cities table
9. Task 8: Cities of California
10. Task 9: Cities by States

Each task is accompanied by a SQL file that contains the necessary queries to complete the task successfully.

## Files

The project contains the following files:

1. 0-privileges.sql
2. 1-create_user.sql
3. 2-create_read_user.sql
4. 3-force_name.sql
5. 4-id_not_null.sql
6. 5-unique_id.sql
7. 6-states.sql
8. 7-cities.sql
9. 8-cities_of_california.sql
10. 9-cities_by_state.sql

You can open each SQL file to view the specific queries related to each task.

## Project Requirements

To successfully work with this project, ensure that you meet the following requirements:

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All files should end with a new line
- All SQL queries should have a comment just before (i.e., syntax above)
- All files should start with a comment describing the task
- All SQL keywords should be in uppercase (SELECT, WHERE, etc.)
- The length of your files will be tested using the `wc` command

## Usage

To run the SQL scripts in this project, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have MySQL installed on your machine.
2. Clone the Git repository: `git clone [repository_url]`.
3. Navigate to the project directory: `cd SQL-More-queries`.
4. Open the desired SQL file using a text editor.
5. Connect to your MySQL server using the appropriate credentials.
6. Copy the contents of the SQL file and paste it into the MySQL command prompt.
7. Execute the queries by pressing Enter.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues while running the SQL scripts, consider the following steps:

- Verify that you have the correct MySQL credentials (username, password, host, port).
- Ensure that your MySQL server is running.
- Double-check the syntax of your SQL queries for any errors or typos.
- Refer to the project documentation and resources for assistance.
