# Python exceptions

Welcome to the "exceptions" Python project! This project contains solutions to a series of coding challenges related to exception handling. The challenges are part of the ALX Software Engineering Program - High-Level Programming.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into multiple tasks, each focusing on a specific aspect of exception handling. Below is an overview of the tasks and their respective files:

### Task 0 - Safe List Printing

- File: `0-safe_print_list.py`
- Description: This task involves implementing a function that safely prints the elements of a list using exception handling.

### Task 1 - Safe Printing of an Integer List

- File: `1-safe_print_integer.py`
- Description: This task builds upon Task 0 and requires implementing a function that safely prints only integers from a list.

### Task 2 - Print and Count Integers

- File: `2-safe_print_list_integers.py`
- Description: This task expands on Task 1 and involves modifying the function to also return the number of integers printed.

### Task 3 - Raise Exception

- File: `3-safe_print_division.py`
- Description: This task requires implementing a function that divides two integers and raises a custom exception for specific conditions.

### Task 4 - Divide a List

- File: `4-list_division.py`
- Description: This task involves implementing a function that divides each element of one list by the corresponding element of another list.

### Task 5 - Raise Exception with Message

- File: `5-raise_exception.py`
- Description: This task requires modifying the division function from Task 3 to raise an exception with a specific error message.

### Task 6 - Safe Function Execution

- File: `100-safe_print_integer_err.py`
- Description: This task involves implementing a function decorator that handles exceptions raised by a given function and prints an error message.

### Task 7 - Safe Function with Stack Traces

- File: `101-safe_function.py`
- Description: This task builds upon Task 6 and requires modifying the function decorator to also print a stack trace when an exception occurs.

### Task 8 - Load from JSON String

- File: `102-load_from_json_string.py`
- Description: This task involves implementing a function that loads a Python object from a JSON string and handles potential exceptions.

### Task 9 - Load from JSON File

- File: `103-magic_calculation.py`
- Description: This task builds upon Task 8 and requires implementing a function that loads a JSON file and returns its deserialized content.

### Task 10 - JSON to Object

- File: `104-test.py`, `104-python.c`
- Description: This task involves creating a Python class that can be serialized to and from a JSON representation.
