## General Info
This project is part of the Alx Higher Level Programming curriculum. It covers Python network programming, specifically focusing on making HTTP requests, handling HTTP responses, and interacting with web APIs using the `urllib` and `requests` libraries.

## Technologies
Project is created with:
* Python 3.8.5
* pycodestyle 2.8.* (for code style checking)

## Setup
To run the scripts in this project, you need to have Python 3 installed on your system. You can download Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

You also need to have the `pycodestyle` package installed for code style checking. You can install it using pip:

```
$ pip install pycodestyle
```

## Usage
To execute the scripts, use the following command format:

```
$ ./script_name.py [arguments]
```

Make sure to replace `script_name.py` with the actual script you want to run and provide any required arguments as specified in the task descriptions.

## Tasks
1. **What's my status? #0** - A script that fetches a URL using `urllib` and displays information about the response.

2. **Response header value #0** - A script that takes a URL, sends a request, and displays the value of the X-Request-Id variable from the response header.

3. **POST an email #0** - A script that sends a POST request to a URL with an email as a parameter and displays the response.

4. **Error code #0** - A script that sends a request to a URL, displays the body of the response, and handles HTTP errors.

5. **What's my status? #1** - A script that fetches a URL using the `requests` library and displays information about the response.

6. **Response header value #1** - A script that takes a URL, sends a request using `requests`, and displays the value of the X-Request-Id variable from the response header.

7. **POST an email #1** - A script that sends a POST request to a URL with an email as a parameter using `requests` and displays the response.

8. **Error code #1** - A script that sends a request to a URL, displays the body of the response, and handles HTTP errors using `requests`.

9. **Search API** - A script that sends a POST request with a letter as a parameter to a specific URL and displays the response. Handles JSON formatting and empty responses.

10. **My GitHub!** - A script that uses Basic Authentication with a personal access token to access GitHub information and displays the user's ID.
