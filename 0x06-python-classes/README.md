# ALX Software Engineering - Higher Level Programming Tasks
# Python Classes

This repository contains my solutions to the Higher Level Programming tasks as part of the ALX Software Engineering program. Each task is implemented in Python and focuses on different concepts and topics in higher-level programming.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into directories, with each directory representing a specific task. Here is an overview of the directories and their corresponding tasks:

- `Ox06-python-classes`: Implementation of various Python classes showcasing object-oriented programming concepts.

- `0-square.py`: Definition of the Square class with basic functionality.

- `1-square.py`: Enhanced version of the Square class with additional methods and attributes.

- `100-singly_linked_list.py`: Implementation of a singly linked list data structure.

- `101-square.py`: Advanced version of the Square class with further improvements.

- `102-square.py`: Square class implementation with optimizations for performance.

- `103-magic-class.py`: Implementation of a MagicClass with optimized bytecode.

- `2-square.py`: Further improvements to the Square class, adding more features.

- `3-square.py`: Square class with enhanced functionality for geometric calculations.

- `4-square.py`: Refactored Square class with improved algorithms.

- `5-square.py`: Final version of the Square class with comprehensive documentation and error handling.

- `6-square.py`: Square class implementation with additional enhancements.

- `README.md`: The file you are currently reading, providing an overview of the repository.

## Usage

To use the code provided in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Dr-dyrane
   ```

2. Navigate to the desired task directory using the command line or your preferred IDE.

3. You can import the relevant Python module into your script or interactive session using the `import` statement. For example:

   ```python
   from Ox06-python-classes.0-square import Square

   # Create an instance of the Square class
   square = Square(5)

   # Access methods and attributes of the square object
   print(square.area())  # Output: 25
   ```

4. Explore the code provided for each task and utilize the implemented functionality for your own projects or learning purposes.
