# Python I/O

This project focuses on input and output operations in Python. It covers reading and writing files, working with JSON, and understanding serialization and deserialization. By completing this project, you will gain a solid understanding of how to handle file input and output in Python and effectively work with different data formats.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to explain the following concepts without the help of external resources:

- The awesomeness of Python programming
- Opening and writing to files in Python
- Reading the full content of a file
- Reading a file line by line
- Navigating the cursor within a file
- Properly closing files after usage
- Utilizing the `with` statement for file handling
- Understanding JSON and its use in data serialization
- Converting Python data structures to JSON strings
- Converting JSON strings to Python data structures

## Requirements

- Python Scripts:

  - Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
  - All files interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python 3.8.5
  - All files should end with a new line
  - The first line of all files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
  - A `README.md` file at the root of the project folder is mandatory
  - Code should follow the PEP 8 style guide (pycodestyle version 2.8.\*)
  - All files must be executable
  - File lengths will be checked using `wc`

- Python Test Cases:
  - Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
  - All files should end with a new line
  - All test files should be inside a folder named `tests`
  - All test files should be text files with a `.txt` extension
  - Tests should be executed using the command `python3 -m doctest ./tests/*`
  - All modules, classes, and functions should have appropriate documentation

**Note**: It is highly recommended to collaborate on test cases to cover different scenarios and edge cases effectively.
