# ALX Program Software Engineering - Python Data Structures

Welcome to the Python Data Structures repository for the ALX Program Software Engineering! This repository, maintained by **Dr-dyrane**, contains a collection of Python scripts that cover various data structures and algorithms. The scripts are designed to help you understand and practice working with different data structures in Python as part of the ALX Software Engineering program.

## Files

Here's a list of the files available in this repository:

1. `0-square_matrix_simple.py`
2. `1-search_replace.py`
3. `10-best_score.py`
4. `100-weight_average.py`
5. `101-square_matrix_map.py`
6. `102-complex_delete.py`
7. `103-python.c`
8. `11-multiply_list_map.py`
9. `12-roman_to_int.py`
10. `2-uniq_add.py`
11. `3-common_elements.py`
12. `4-only_diff_elements.py`
13. `5-number_keys.py`
14. `6-print_sorted_dictionary.py`
15. `7-update_dictionary.py`
16. `8-simple_delete.py`
17. `9-multiply_by_2.py`

## Usage

To use any of the scripts, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where the script is located.
3. Run the script using the following command:

   ```bash
   ./filename.py
   ```

   Replace `filename.py` with the actual name of the script you want to execute.

For the C file (`103-python.c`), you will need to compile it before running it using a C compiler, such as GCC. The compilation command may vary depending on your operating system.

## Contributions

Contributions to this repository are welcome! If you would like to contribute improvements or additional scripts related to Python data structures, please open a pull request. Together, we can make this repository a valuable resource for learning and practicing Python programming.
