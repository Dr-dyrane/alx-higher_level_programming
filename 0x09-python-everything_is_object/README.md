## Description

In this project, we delve into the inner workings of Python and its handling of objects. We gain a deeper understanding of Python's object-oriented nature and explore concepts such as mutability, immutability, reference, and assignment. By completing the tasks and answering questions, we strengthen our knowledge of Python and enhance our ability to tackle related questions during interviews or while working on Python projects.

## Learning Objectives

Upon completing this project, you will be able to:

- Understand the concept of objects in Python
- Differentiate between mutable and immutable objects
- Explore the relationship between variables and objects
- Identify aliases and their implications
- Determine if two variables are identical or linked to the same object
- Display the memory address (variable identifier) of an object
- Recognize and explain the characteristics of built-in mutable and immutable types in Python
- Understand how Python passes variables to functions

## Tasks

The project tasks involve answering questions and providing concise solutions. The questions and tasks are designed to deepen your understanding of Python's specific behavior and prepare you for Python-related job interviews. It is essential to read the documentation, think critically, and collaborate with your peers to gain a comprehensive understanding of the topics.

## Files

The project includes the following files:

- `0-answer.txt`
- `1-answer.txt`
- ...
- `N-answer.txt`

Each file contains a single line representing the answer to a specific task. The answers should be concise and follow the provided format.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8.5
- Pycodestyle 2.8.\* (for adhering to code style guidelines)
